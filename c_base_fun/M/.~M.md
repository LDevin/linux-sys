内存分配函数
DESCRIPTION
    The  malloc()  function allocates size bytes and returns a pointer to the allocated memory.  The memory is
    not initialized.  If size is 0, then malloc() returns either NULL, or a  unique  pointer  value  that  can
    later be successfully passed to free().

    The  free() function frees the memory space pointed to by ptr, which must have been returned by a previous
    call to malloc(), calloc(), or realloc().  Otherwise, or if free(ptr)  has  already  been  called  before,
undefined behavior occurs.  If ptr is NULL, no operation is performed.

    The  calloc()  function  allocates  memory for an array of nmemb elements of size bytes each and returns a
    pointer to the allocated memory.  The memory is set to zero.  If nmemb or size is 0, then calloc() returns
    either NULL, or a unique pointer value that can later be successfully passed to free().

    The realloc() function changes the size of the memory block pointed to by ptr to size bytes.  The contents
    will be unchanged in the range from the start of the region up to the minimum of the old  and  new  sizes.
    If  the  new  size is larger than the old size, the added memory will not be initialized.  If ptr is NULL,
then the call is equivalent to malloc(size), for all values of size; if size is equal to zero, and ptr  is
    not  NULL, then the call is equivalent to free(ptr).  Unless ptr is NULL, it must have been returned by an
    earlier call to malloc(), calloc() or realloc().  If the area pointed to was moved, a free(ptr) is done.

    RETURN VALUE
    The malloc() and calloc() functions return a pointer to the allocated memory, which  is  suitably  aligned
    for  any built-in type.  On error, these functions return NULL.  NULL may also be returned by a successful
        call to malloc() with a size of zero, or by a successful call to calloc() with  nmemb  or  size  equal  to
        zero.

        The free() function returns no value.

        The  realloc() function returns a pointer to the newly allocated memory, which is suitably aligned for any
        built-in type and may be different from ptr, or NULL if the request fails.  If size was equal to 0, either
            NULL  or a pointer suitable to be passed to free() is returned.  If realloc() fails, the original block is
            left untouched; it is not freed or moved.
